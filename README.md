# Syllable

**A user friendly, POSIX compatible operating system**

Reducing software waste

**Syllable Desktop** is a unique, modern and complete operating system that is easy to use, powerful, lightweight and extraordinarily fast and responsive. It has its own, tightly integrated kernel, file system, Graphical User Interface and applications, and also supports many cross-platform open-source programs. Syllable is designed in the tradition of the Amiga and BeOS, but built using many parts from the GNU project and Linux. It excels at interactive use.

Syllable Server is a matching, small and efficient, companion Linux system. It uses the Linux kernel and is compatible with Linux software, but is otherwise built to be as similar as possible to the primary Syllable system.

Syllable makes better use of your hardware by reducing waste in the software. Syllable Desktop runs on industry-standard Personal Computers with a minimum of a Pentium compatible processor and 32 MB of memory. It can make a new or tiny computer extremely fast and an old computer usable again.
